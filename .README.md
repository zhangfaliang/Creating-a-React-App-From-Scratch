# react-starter

react-starter is a simple starting point for Single Page Apps using React, Babel, and Webpack.

## Folder Structure

```JAVASCRIPT
.
+-- public
| +-- favicon.ico
| +-- index.html
| +-- manifest.json
+-- src
| +-- Components
|   +-- Message
|     +-- Message.css
|     +-- Message.js
| +-- App.css
| +-- App.js
| +-- index.js
+-- .babelrc
+-- .eslintrc
+-- .gitignore
+-- CONTRIBUTING
+-- LICENSE
+-- package-lock.json
+-- package.json
+-- README.md
+-- webpack.config.js
```

## Usage

(Note: this project was created in Node v9.3.0)
Clone this repo and install dependencies with `npm install`.

### Starting The Dev Server

To start the server and start hacking, run

```BASH
npm start
```

This starter uses webpack-dev-server to spin up an Express server with Hot-Reloading capability. Changes to code in `.src` should cause pages to reload.

## Static Assets

Static Assets are served from the `/public` folder.

## Styling

Stylesheets are bundled along with project files in the `.src` folder, so you can divide your stylesheets by component (or any other configuration you plan)

#Bundling
To bundle your files, run

```BASH
npm run build
```

This will bundle your files at `<projectRoot>/dist/bundle.js`. `index.html` already references this location, allowing you build and open `index.html` without having to start the server. Note that there are no optimizations in place at this time.
